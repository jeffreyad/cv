Jeff Dickinson is a professional Associate Director, Clinical Reporting, with more than 29 years of experience in pharmaceutical data science and statistical programming. Over the past four years, he has focused intensively on R programming and open-source development, leading teams of programmers and QC reviewers in implementing new processes using R and Git version control. He is recognized as an expert in clinical reporting, biostatistical programming, and Pharmacokinetics (PK), with specialized expertise in CDISC data standards and the pharmaverse ecosystem.

**Recent R and Open-Source Leadership (2021-Present):**

- **Admiral Core Team Member** (4 years): Active core developer and maintainer of admiral packages, contributing to the pharmaverse ecosystem for CDISC-compliant clinical trial data analysis
- Led organizational transition to R-based workflows, establishing Git version control processes and modern development practices for clinical programming teams
- **PHUSE Working Group Member**: The Use of Git in Statistical Programming - Contributing to industry standards for version control in regulated environments
- Developer of functions for pharmacokinetic analysis including timepoint conversion (`convert_xxtpt_to_hours()`) and NFRLT derivation (`derive_var_nfrlt()`)
- Implementation of automated testing frameworks achieving >80% code coverage across multiple packages
- Development of JSON file handling functionality for metacore package specifications
- Creator of exposure-response modeling workflows using CDISC standards and admiral
- Contributor to pharmaverse documentation and example implementations

**Earlier Experience:**

Project Manager for PK teams; developer of macros for standardized PK dataset programming; development and QC programming for NONMEM and Exposure Response analysis; QC programming team lead for global series of clinical studies utilizing CDISC data standards (SDTM and ADaM); clinical data programming for tables, listings, graphs, and patient profiles for NDA submissions; technical SAS programming and project management of clinical programming teams.
